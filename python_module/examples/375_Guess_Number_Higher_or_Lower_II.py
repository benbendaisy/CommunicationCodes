        We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

        I pick a number between 1 and n.
        You guess a number.
        If you guess the right number, you win the game.
        If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
        Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
        Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.

        Example 1:

        Input: n = 10
        Output: 16
        Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
        - The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
            - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
            - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
                - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
                - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
                - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
            - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
                - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
                - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
                    - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
                    - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
                    - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
                - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
                    - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
                    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
        The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 1
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.
        Example 3:

        Input: n = 2
        Output: 1
        Explanation: There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
        - Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
        The worst case is that you pay $1.
