1. Data Preparation and Representation
Multimodal Data (Text and Images):

Image Embeddings: You'll need a pre-trained vision model (e.g., ResNet, ViT) to generate embeddings for your images. PyTorch's torchvision.models can be used here.
Text Embeddings: A pre-trained sentence transformer model (e.g., from the sentence-transformers library, which is built on PyTorch) can be used to generate text embeddings.
Storage: Store these embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone) for efficient similarity search. Each image and its associated text description (if any) should be linked.
Knowledge Graph Data:

Graph Representation: Your knowledge graph (KG) consists of entities and relations (e.g., (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples).
KG Embeddings: Generate embeddings for entities and relations using KG embedding models like TransE, DistMult, or ComplEx. Libraries like PyTorch BigGraph (PBG) or PyKEEN can be helpful here.
Storage: Store the KG and its embeddings. You might use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) or store embeddings in a vector store alongside your multimodal data.
2. The Retriever Module
This module is responsible for finding the most relevant information based on the user's query.

Query Processing:

The input query can be text or a combination of text and image (multimodal query).
If the query includes an image, generate its embedding using the same vision model as for your dataset images.
If the query is text, generate its embedding using the same text model.
Multimodal Retrieval:

Perform a similarity search in your vector database using the query embedding against the stored image and text embeddings.
Retrieve top-K multimodal results (image-text pairs).
Knowledge Graph Retrieval:

Entity Linking: Identify entities from the user's query and link them to entities in your KG.
Subgraph Retrieval: Based on the linked entities, retrieve relevant subgraphs or paths from your KG. This might involve traversing the graph or using KG querying languages (e.g., SPARQL if using a triple store).
Alternatively, you can perform similarity search using the query embedding against the KG entity/relation embeddings if you've designed your KG embedding space to be comparable.
Fusion/Ranking (Optional but Recommended):

You might need a mechanism to rank and fuse the results from multimodal and KG retrieval, especially if there's overlap or varying relevance. This could be a simple scoring mechanism or a learnable ranking model.
3. The Augmentation Step
Combine the retrieved information with the original query.

Formatting: Convert the retrieved multimodal data (e.g., image captions, relevant text snippets) and KG information (e.g., facts as text, paths as sequences of entities/relations) into a textual format that the generator model can understand.
Concatenation: Prepend or append this formatted context to the original user query.
4. The Generator Module (Large Language Model)
This module takes the augmented query and generates the final answer.

Model Choice: Use a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model or a decoder-only LLM (e.g., from the Hugging Face transformers library like BART, T5, or a GPT variant).
Input: The augmented query (original query + retrieved context).
Output: The generated answer.
Fine-tuning (Optional but often beneficial): You can fine-tune the generator model on a dataset of (augmented query, answer) pairs to improve its ability to synthesize information from diverse sources and generate coherent answers.
