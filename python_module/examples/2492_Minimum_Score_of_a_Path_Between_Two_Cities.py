        You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

        The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

        Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

        Note:

        A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
        It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
        The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.

        Example 1:

        Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
        It can be shown that no other path has less score.
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
