        Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

        According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

        If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

        Example 1:

        Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
        Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
        Example 2:

        Input: citations = [1,3,1]
        Output: 1

        Constraints:

        n == citations.length
        1 <= n <= 5000
        0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
