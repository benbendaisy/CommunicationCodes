        You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

        Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

        Example 1:

        Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
        Example 2:

        Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

        Constraints:

        The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
        Node.val == 0
