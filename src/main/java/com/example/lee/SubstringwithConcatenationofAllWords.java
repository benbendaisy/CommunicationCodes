 * Created by benbendaisy on 2/26/15.
 *
 * You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 *
 * For example, given:
 * S: "barfoothefoobarman"
 * L: ["foo", "bar"]
 *
 * You should return the indices: [0,9].
 * (order does not matter).
